# Terraform Kubernetes Installer for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

## About

The Kubernetes Installer for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a Terraform-based Kubernetes installation for Oracle 
Cloud Infrastructure. It consists of a set of [Terraform][terraform] modules and an example base configuration that is 
used to provision and configure the resources needed to run a highly available and configurable Kubernetes cluster on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure][bmcs] (OCI).

## Cluster Configuration Overview

The base Terraform infrastructure configuration and default variables provision:

- a Virtual Cloud Network with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16 and dedicated public subnets for etcd, workers, and masters
- a dedicated set of Instances for the Kubernetes control plane to run on
- a _public_ OCI TCP/SSL Load Balancer to front-end the K8s API server cluster
- a _private_ OCI Load Balancer to front-end the etcd cluster

The base Kubernetes cluster configuration includes:

- 3 back-end etcd instances - one for each availability domain
- 3 back-end k8s master instances - one for each availability domain
- 3 k8s workers instances - one for each availability domain
- self-signed cluster certificates for _authenticating_ API requests
- Kubernetes RBAC (role-based authorization control) for _authorizing_ API requests
- Flannel/CNI for handling multi-host container networking

The base infrastructure and cluster configuration also accept input variables that allow you to specify the instance 
shapes and how they are placed across the availability domain (ADs). If your requirements extend beyond the base 
configuration, the modules can be used to form your own customized configuration.

## Prerequisites

1. Download and install [Terraform][terraform]
2. Download and install the [OCI Terraform Provider][oci provider] (v2.0.0 or later)
3. Create an Terraform configuration file at  `~/.terraformrc` that specifies the path to the OCI provider:
```
providers {
  oci = "<path_to_provider_binary>/terraform-provider-oci"
}
```
4. Create a _terraform.tfvars_ file in the project root that specifies your [API signature](API signing), tenancy, user, and compartment within OCI:

```bash
# start from the included example
$ cp terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
```
5.  Ensure you have [Kubectl][Kubectl] installed

## Quick start

To run the Terraform scripts, you'll first need to download and install the Terraform binary and [OCI Provider][bmcs provider] as well as OCI access. Check out the [prerequisites](README.md#prerequisites) section for more details.

The quickest way to get a Kubernetes cluster up and running on OCI is to simply use the base configuration defined in 
the top-level file `k8s-oci.tf`:

```bash
# initialize your Terraform configuration including the modules
$ terraform init

# optionally customize the deployment by overriding input variable defaults in `terraform.tfvars` as you see fit

# see what Terraform will do before actually doing it
$ terraform plan

# provision resources and stand-up k8s cluster on OCI
$ terraform apply
```

The Kubernetes cluster will be running after the configuration is applied successfully and the cluster installation 
scripts have been given time to finish asynchronously. Typically this takes around 5 minutes after `terraform apply` 
and will vary depending on the instance counts and shapes.

#### Access the Kubernetes API server

The master, worker, and etcd security groups only allow VCN ingress (10.0.0.0/16) by default. 

To open access HTTPs access to your master API server, which will enable the Kubernetes Dashboard and kubectl to be 
reachable from the outside, run:

```bash
# warning: 0.0.0.0/0 is wide open. Consider limiting HTTPs ingress to smaller set of IPs.
$ terraform plan -var master_https_ingress=0.0.0.0/0
$ terraform apply -var master_https_ingress=0.0.0.0/0
# consider closing access off again using terraform apply -var master_https_ingress=10.0.0.0/16
```

##### Access the cluster using kubectl

You can also use `kubectl` to interact with your cluster using the kubeconfig found in the ./generated folder or using the `kubeconfig` Terraform output variable.

```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/generated/kubeconfig
$ kubectl cluster-info
$ kubectl get nodes
```

##### Access the cluster using Kubernetes Dashboard

To access the Kubernetes Dashboard, use `kubectl proxy`:

```
kubectl proxy &
open http://localhost:8001/ui
```

##### Verifying your cluster:

To do a quick and automated verification of your cluster, run the `cluster-check.sh` located in the `scripts` directory.  Note that this script requires your KUBECONFIG environment variable to be set (above), and SSH and HTTPs access to be open to etcd and worker nodes.

To temporarily open access SSH and HTTPs access for `cluster-check.sh`, add the following to your `terraform.tfvars` file:

```bash
# warning: 0.0.0.0/0 is wide open. remember to undo this.
etcd_ssh_ingress = "0.0.0.0/0"
master_ssh_ingress = "0.0.0.0/0"
worker_ssh_ingress = "0.0.0.0/0"
master_https_ingress = "0.0.0.0/0"
worker_nodeport_ingress = "0.0.0.0/0"
```


```bash
$ scripts/cluster-check.sh
```
```
[cluster-check.sh] Running some basic checks on Kubernetes cluster....
[cluster-check.sh]   Checking ssh connectivity to each node...
[cluster-check.sh]   Checking whether instance bootstrap has completed on each node...
[cluster-check.sh]   Checking Flannel's etcd key from each node...
[cluster-check.sh]   Checking whether expected system services are running on each node...

[cluster-check.sh]   Checking status of /healthz endpoint at the LB...
[cluster-check.sh]   Running 'kubectl get nodes' a number or times through the master LB...

The Kubernetes cluster is up and appears to be healthy.
Kubernetes master is running at https://129.146.22.175:443
KubeDNS is running at https://129.146.22.175:443/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns
kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://129.146.22.175:443/ui
```

#### SSH into OCI Instances

To open access SSH access to your master nodes, add the following to your `terraform.tfvars` file:

```bash
# warning: 0.0.0.0/0 is wide open. remember to undo this.
etcd_ssh_ingress = "0.0.0.0/0"
master_ssh_ingress = "0.0.0.0/0"
worker_ssh_ingress = "0.0.0.0/0"
```

```bash
# Create local SSH private key file logging into OCI instances
$ terraform output ssh_private_key > generated/instances_id_rsa
# Retrieve public IP for etcd nodes
$ terraform output etcd_public_ips
# Log in as user opc to the Oracle Linux OS
$ ssh -i `pwd`/generated/instances_id_rsa opc@ETCD_INSTANCE_IP
# Retrieve public IP for k8s masters
$ terraform output master_public_ips
$ ssh -i `pwd`/generated/instances_id_rsa opc@K8SMASTER_INSTANCE_IP
# Retrieve public IP for k8s workers
$ terraform output worker_public_ips
$ ssh -i `pwd`/generated/instances_id_rsa opc@K8SWORKER_INSTANCE_IP
```

### Examples

#### Deploying a new cluster

Override any of the above input variables in your terraform.tfvars and run the plan and apply commands:

```bash
# verify what will change
$ terraform plan

# scale workers
$ terraform apply
```

#### Scaling k8s workers (in or out) using terraform apply

To scale workers in or out, adjust the `k8sWorkerAd1Count`, `k8sWorkerAd2Count`, or `k8sWorkerAd3Count` input 
variables in terraform.tfvars and run the plan and apply commands:

```bash
# verify changes
$ terraform plan

# scale workers (use -target=module.instances-k8sworker-adX to only target workers in a particular AD)
$ terraform apply
```

When scaling worker nodes _up_, you will need to wait for the node initialization to finish asynchronously before 
the new nodes will be seen with `kubectl get nodes`

When scaling worker nodes _down_, the instances/k8sworker module's user_data code will take care of running `kubectl drain` and `kubectl delete node` on the nodes being terminated.

#### Scaling k8s masters (in or out) using terraform apply

To scale the masters in or out, adjust the `k8sMasterAd1Count`, `k8sMasterAd2Count`, or `k8sMasterAd3Count` input variables in terraform.tfvars and run the plan and apply commands:

```bash
# verify changes
$ terraform plan

# scale master nodes
$ terraform apply
```

Similar to the initial deployment, you will need to wait for the node initialization to finish asynchronously.

#### Scaling etcd nodes (in or out) using terraform apply

Scaling the etcd nodes in or out after the initial deployment is not currently supported. Terminating all the nodes in the etcd cluster will result in data loss.

#### Replacing worker nodes using terraform taint

We can use `terraform taint` to worker instances in a particular AD as "tainted", which will cause
 them to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply. This can be a useful strategy for reverting local changes or 
 regenerating a misbehaving worker.

```bash
# taint all workers in AD1
terraform taint -module=instances-k8sworker-ad1 oci_core_instance.TFInstanceK8sWorker
# optionally taint workers in AD2 and AD3 or do so in a subsequent apply
# terraform taint -module=instances-k8sworker-ad2 oci_core_instance.TFInstanceK8sWorker
# terraform taint -module=instances-k8sworker-ad3 oci_core_instance.TFInstanceK8sWorker

# preview changes
$ terraform plan

# replace workers
$ terraform apply
```

#### Replacing masters using terraform taint

We can also use `terraform taint` to master instances in a particular AD as "tainted", which will cause
 them to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply. This can be a useful strategy for reverting local 
 changes or regenerating a misbehaving master.

```bash
# taint all masters in AD1
terraform taint -module=instances-k8smaster-ad1 oci_core_instance.TFInstanceK8sMaster
# optionally taint masters in AD2 and AD3 or do so in a subsequent apply
# terraform taint -module=instances-k8smaster-ad2 oci_core_instance.TFInstanceK8sMaster
# terraform taint -module=instances-k8smaster-ad3 oci_core_instance.TFInstanceK8sMaster

# preview changes
$ terraform plan

# replace workers
$ terraform apply
```

#### Replacing etcd cluster members using terraform taint

Replacing etcd cluster members after the initial deployment is not currently supported.

### Configure docker log sizes and rotation file counts
All docker containers currently are configured to use the json-file logging driver with the following settings:
```
max-size=50m  max-file=5
```
where:
```
   max-size: maximum size of log before it is rolled units(k,m, or g)  
   max-file: maximum number of files that can be present before oldest is removed  
   ```
To change this, add any desired modification to your terraform.tfvars file.  
For example, to change the k8sworker docker log file rotation from 5 to 3.  
```
worker_docker_max_log_files = "3"
```
To change the k8smaster docker log file size from 50m to 100m
```
master_docker_max_log_size = "100m"
```
