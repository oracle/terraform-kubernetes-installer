module: health_check
short_description: Checks that an HTTP server is responding as expected.
description:
    - Sends multiple HTTP requests to a URL until the expected response is
      received. The number of retries, the delay between retries as well as
      the expected response are configurable.
    - Install this module by putting the file C(health_check) in a directory
      named C(library) under your playbook or role directory.
notes:
    - Requires urllib2
options:
    url:
        description:
            - URLs to perform health checks on.
        required: true
    headers:
        description:
            - Dictionary of HTTP headers to send in the request.
        default: null
    initial_delay:
        description:
            - Number of seconds to wait before sending the first request.
        default: '0'
    delay_between_tries:
        description:
            - Number of seconds to wait between tries.
        default: 5
    max_retries:
        description:
            - Number of times to try before giving up.
        default: 10
    timeout:
        description:
            - Number of seconds to wait for a response for each request. If
              a response is not received within this number of second, the
              attempt is considered to be a failure.
        default: 10
    expected_status:
        description:
           - Expected HTTP status code. If the server responds with a
             different status code, then the attempt is considered to be
             a failure.
        default: 200
    expected_regexp:
        description:
           - An optional regular expression that can be used to validate the
             response from the server. If the response body does not match the
             regular expression the attempt is considered as failed. Note that
             the regular expression tries to match from the beginning of the
             response. If you want to search anywhere within the response body
             use an expression like ".*OK"
        required: false
        default: null
